# Rämixx500
Rämixx500 is an Open Hardware remake of the Commodore Amiga 500+ mainboard, revision 8A.1.

## Summary
Many Amiga 500+ computers are suffering an early death because of the built-in barrel battery that powers their internal real-time clocks. Such batteries have long exceeded their planned lives and in many cases have started to leak alkaline liquids over the mainboard, corroding copper traces and destroying components.

This damage can sometimes be repaired trivially, but many times it requires a lot of time and effort. Sometimes it adds up to other damage occurred over time and so it would just be better to have a new board built with new components to move the few critical chips over. Amiga mainboards haven't been produced for the last 30 years, but they are relatively simple by today's standards, thus an amateur project to make new ones was started.

There are other projects like this one out there, but none of them is Open Source and none of them comes with both schematics and board. This is a big advantage, since anyone can modify the board and make new improved versions, as long as they release their modifications it with the same license. I have come up with [some ideas for improvements](https://github.com/SukkoPera/Raemixx500/issues/14), feel free to help :).

Now the bad news: **THIS BOARD IS UNTESTED!!! IT MIGHT NOT WORK AT ALL!** It might kill your cat or burn your house down. You have been warned.

While this might look deceiving at first, **it is actually an opportunity to showcase the full potential of Open Hardware**: download the project files, inspect them and [report any errors](https://github.com/SukkoPera/Raemixx500/issues) you find! This way we can all work together to get a perfect board.

## Differences from original
The initial objective was to come up with a new mainboard as similar to the original one as possible, while including minor modifications that would improve its usability. First the schematics were drawn from scratch in Kicad and then the board was routed, staying close to the original layout.

This mainboard was designed with *reasonable* - not *maniacal* - accuracy to the original design. Most care was taken in the positioning of components the ought to be in a certain position (i.e.: screw holes and I/O connectors), to ensure drop-in replaceability. Other components and tracks are "more or less" there, but as the board was wholly laid out from scratch by hand, don't expect sub-millimeter accuracy.

Following is a list of deliberate changes with respect to the original layout of the A500+ rev.8A.1 board:
- The footprints for all DIP chips use "long pads". This makes them easier to solder and more solid to the board should you need to rework them. This forced a few tracks running very close to the original pads to be slightly offset away.
- C99 was added to allow for the correct usage of 318069-10/11 Agnus chips. Leave open for others (only 8375 will work).
- The power connector was altered to either accept the original one or a DIN-5. Make sure you get one rated for a few amps if you choose the latter.
- The barrel battery was replaced with a BS-7 battery holder for a normal (non-rechargeable) CR2032 battery. Consequently, R913 has been replaced with a diode and a couple of tracks needed some displacement.
- The need to solder D912 to a leg of the former R913 has been removed. Just solder it in its place.
- The RCA jacks for the audio and composite video outputs have been replaced with some that can actually be found nowadays (i.e.: those that were used on A600/A1200). This resulted in relocating R409 (whose original position seems somehow improvised anyway...).
- The above allowed a couple of tracks to be added so that the left and right audio channels will be somehow mixed whenever a single output jack is connected. This was lifted from the A600.
- The silkscreen for some components does not match the original one. I used the built-in KiCad footprints as-is, when available.
- The silkscreen and pitch of C303 and C304 have been made smaller so that they don't overlap.
- Speaking about the silkscreen, I have been quite liberal with it. I have used the default KiCad font and I did not follow the original label placement one at all costs. This was since today's technology can give us a bit more resolution in silkscreen printing, and I think that is worth using for the sake of clarity. Some ground stitching vias were slightly offset to make up space for labels.
- The vias inside the pads of JP10A and JP11 have been slightly offset so that they are outside the pads.
- The ground fill is autogenerated by KiCad, so it won't match the original exactly.
- Probably there's something more I've forgotten.

## Assembly and Installation
Again: **PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS UNTESTED!!! IT MIGHT NOT WORK AT ALL!**

You will probably want to install all new components on this. Most passives should be easy to find, except for the axial caps and EMI filters.

The connectors are all on the market, except for the Video and Floppy ones, which are non-standard DB-23. You will need to recover these from a failed board. The same applies for the power connector, but the board should also accept a standard DIN-5 (or even DIN-8, I think). Make sure to wire it properly. Oh, I have no idea if the line filter can be bought new, so you'd better recover that, too.

Other things you will need to recover are all the custom Commodore ICs, of course. Make sure you are using an 8375 Agnus, and populate C99 accordingly.

CPUs can be found second-hand cheaply. Every serious electronics shop should have all the 7400-series chips.

I would suggest using sockets for all ICs. Get new good-quality ones. 48-pin are hard to obtain, but you can easily replace them with two 24-pin side by side. Be careful with the RAM chips: if you socket them, they will probably be too tall for the keyboard to fit properly.

You will also need to recover the original quartz, as it has an uncommon frequency. But you can try replacing it with a [DFO](https://nfggames.com/forum2/index.php?topic=5744.0). With a properly-programmed one you should even be able to support both PAL and NTSC Agnus chips with the switch of a button.

You can recover the original Video Hybrid, or you can [build a new one](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenAmigaVideoHybrid).

The solder jumpers should all be preset with the most common value. You will only need to take care of JP4 if you install only 512k chip RAM: in this case DO NOT install U32 and put a blob of solder on the center and bottom pads of both JP4A and B.

Good luck! ;)

## Releases
If you want to get this board produced, you are recommended to get [the latest release](https://github.com/SukkoPera/Raemixx500/releases) rather than the current git version, as the latter might be under development and is not guaranteed to be working.

Every release is accompanied by its Bill Of Materials (BOM) file and any relevant notes about it, which you are recommended to read carefully.

**I am not providing ready-to-use gerber files**. If all you want is **to get boards made, I would really appreciate if you did so [in a way that supports the project](#support-the-project)**.

## License
*(I am not sure I can claim any copyright on this, as the actual schematics this is based on belong to Commodore (or whoever has that right now, definitely not me). So the claim below is going to be more of a declaration of intent, in the sense that I would like that everything that uses my work stays open and free.)*

## Selling the board
**The license allows you to sell these boards**. I have nothing against that **as long as you do so at an "ethical" price**. I understand you want to make some money, but please note that you are getting this all for free. You had no development costs and you invested no time in this project. I did, and my desire is to allow everybody to have a board at a REASONABLE price, so please keep your margin low. I estimate that **having a few of these boards produced costs about 20€ per board** (with ENIG, gold plating and beveling the edge connector, don't cheat on that!), so let me add the following restriction: **if this board is sold at more than 30€, 25% of your earning MUST be donated to a LEGITIMATE charity** of some kind, like curing cancer for example.

Also, please **do not remove the credits, URL and license statement**. There is **no reason do so**, you have the right to sell this board, there is no need to pretend you got it somewhere else. Ironically, If you removed those, you'd lose that right as you'd be violating the license terms.
